The STM32F411 is preferred to STM32F401 because of the FPU, more memory, and also because the second generation (g2) 
xtal drive allows more xtal possibilities and lower power consumption. Prices do not seem to be very different.

Notes from  AN2867

- p23 section 4  Guidelines to select a suitable crystal and external components

- From Fig 12, p23 discussing LSE but seems to apply to HSE too:
   High load-capacitance (such as 12.5 pF) requires more power to drive the oscillation. 
   Low power designs consequently needs relatively small load capacitance. 
   Big load capacitance resonators have a much smaller pullabilty.
   7pF in in the middle, the largest possilbe with low power drive and reasonably good pullabilty.

- p24 crystals with high ESR have longer startup time. Small crystals tend to have large ESR. 
  Without size constraints choose a crystal with the smallest possible ESR.
  In noisy environments (eg industrial applications) with no power constraints, choose crystals with high
  load capacitance. 

- p25 Table 5 for which MCUs have which LSE oscillators, and thus implication for which crystals work.

- p26 4.2  How to select an STM32-compatible crystal

- p31 which suggests cap values for various crystals  and tips in section 7!

- p10 For startup and stable oscillation of STM32 and STM8 products, the ratio between
the negative resistance of the loop and the crystal maximal equivalent series resistance
(ESR) is needed. It is recommended to have a ratio higher
than 5 for the HSE oscillators, and higher than 3 for the LSE oscillators.

- p13 the ratio between oscillator gain and oscillation loop critical gain cannot just (sic) exceed 1.
  For cristal specified  Gm_crit_max  check for oscillation loop critical crystal gain p13.

"It's better to measure freq on first PCB release/prototype sample via MCO pin (available on 
PA8 + others depends on device and package size). 
Measuring must be done by counter or by scope with averaging (or in counter mode) to avoid short 
term jitter. And then tune external capacitors accordingly to get nominal crystal frequency.
fmeas > fnom \u2026 increase external capacitors
fmeas < fnom \u2026 decrease external capacitors
"

//////// Low speed oscillator (LSE)  F = 32.768   # kHz 

The sweet point for LSE crystals seems to be 7pF  from AN2867 Fig 12 p23). 
This can acheive low power drive requirement and low drift.
